# City-Proximity-Mapper
City Proximity Mapper is a sophisticated Python tool designed to determine the nearest cities to a specified geographic coordinate, with optional filters for minimum population and limiting the number of results. This utility reads city data including location and population, and provides fast, accurate proximity searches using Vincenty's and Haversine formulas.

## Features

- **Geographic Search**: Enter latitude and longitude to find nearby cities.
- **Population Filtering**: Option to specify a minimum population for the cities returned.
- **Result Limitation**: Ability to limit the number of cities returned.
- **Precision Calculations**: Utilizes Vincenty's formula for high-accuracy distance calculations with Haversine as a fallback.
